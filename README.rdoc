Sprites are great to limit the number of http requests.

The usual way to display an image is to include it in a div with `overflow: hidden` and adjust the left, top properties. This works well, but it is very annoying to compute those values, and you might have to do it again if your sprite changes! Here we do that for you!

1 Use `grunt-spritesmith` to generate your sprite image and a .less file, let say `sprite.less`
2 in your main .less file, add the line `@import 'sprite';` to include the sprite image properties, and `@import 'img_generator'` to load our function.
3 in your html code, include a contaniner like a `div` with an `img` element within, for instance `<div class="img_1"><img src="sprite.png"/></div>`
4 Let say your original image is img_1_src.png and you want it to be displayed with width 40px.  Then add the line `.img_1{ .sprite_to_img(~"img_1_src", 40); }`
(5) you can specify a height/width ratio transformation if different from 1 by using `.img_1{ .sprite_to_img(~"-img_1_src", 40, 2); }` This will double the height from the initial value.
